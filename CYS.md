**Decrypting the Cipher Code**

Objective:

You are tasked with recovering a file that was locked with an unknown password. The thief left behind a mp3(Morse code) file that used to find the secret key. Use your skills to solve the problem and recover the file.

**Mp3 File(Morse Code)**

First of all i copied the morse code and went to this https://www.madeintext.com/morse-code-translator/ site for Morse Code output and we got the Output as **s3cr3tk3y@123456**.
Morse Code OUTPUT: s3cr3tk3y@123456 or S3CR3TK3Y@123456

Then we went for AEC Encryption steps on this https://www.devglan.com/online-tools/aes-encryption-decryption site and at the end of the page we got some interface to encrypt or decrypt. We copied the Cipher Code and pAsted it in the AES Encrypted Text field and we again copied the Morse Code output and pasted it on Enter Secret Key used for Encryption field.

Then we got the Output as "algorithmissafe". We used this keyword to open the ecrypted pdf file (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Oz1HQ_6l_S2u6dS9vNsq_mPmgLIzPsyt/view).

At the end of the pdf doc we got the Secret Code: CogML24@2024
